# Renamer
automated file naming system for any file of any extension to a desired extension


<h3> To do: </h3>

- Clone this repo at any location in your PC (the path is relatively set, so changing location of this directory won't break the code)

- Keep files (to be renamed) inside "folder/" 

- Run rename.py

Note: for customizations, edit "rename.py" to tweak target extension and custom file_name_prefix
